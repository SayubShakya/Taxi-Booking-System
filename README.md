# Taxi Booking System

## Introduction
The Taxi Booking System is a desktop application designed to make booking taxis fast, simple, and reliable. Built using Python, this project uses Tkinter for the user interface, MySQL for the database, and follows computational thinking principles. The development process includes creating UML diagrams to design the system effectively.

This system is useful for:
- Customers: To book a taxi from anywhere, anytime, and reach their destination.
- Drivers: To get steady work opportunities and manage their trips.
- Administrators: To assign drivers efficiently and manage bookings.

### Tools and Technologies Used:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **GUI Library**: Tkinter
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Software**: 
  - Python IDE (e.g. VS Code)
  - MySQL Workbench
  - UML Diagram Tools (e.g., Visual Paradigm)

With this system, customers provide their pickup/drop-off addresses, date, and time, making booking seamless. The system is secure and reliable, storing all data to prevent theft or fraud. Drivers are professional, and the system ensures smooth communication between all parties involved.

## Challenges
Creating and running a taxi booking system comes with some challenges:
- Competing with traditional taxi services.
- Managing delays due to traffic, which can lead to bad reviews.
- Covering expenses for drivers, such as vehicle repairs and fuel.
- Keeping the system updated with modern features.

## How We Solve These Challenges
We address these challenges by:
- Ensuring safety and reliability to build customer trust.
- Adding map navigation to help drivers avoid traffic and take faster routes.
- Hiring professional drivers to enhance customer experience.
- Regularly updating the system to stay relevant and user-friendly.

## Why It Matters
This system is designed for the modern age, appealing especially to younger users who prefer online booking. It provides a secure, fast, and convenient way to book taxis. At the same time, it supports drivers by providing steady work opportunities. As technology evolves, this system can grow and replace traditional booking methods.

## Goals
- Simplify the process of booking taxis.
- Ensure reliability, safety, and timeliness.
- Provide excellent service to both customers and drivers.
- Build a system that adapts to future needs.


## What This Project Does
This project includes three main roles:

1. **Customer**:
   - Register an account with details like name, address, and email.
   - Log in to book taxis by providing pickup/drop-off addresses, date, and time.
   - View and cancel bookings as needed.

2. **Driver**:
   - Register or log in with valid credentials.
   - View assigned trips and complete rides for customers.

3. **Administrator**:
   - Assign active drivers to customers.
   - Manage bookings to prevent conflicts or duplicates.

This project is built to meet all assignment requirements while creating a smooth user experience.


## My Experience
Working on this project has been a fantastic journey. I learned:
- Using Python libraries like Tkinter for GUI development.
- Managing databases with MySQL.
- Debugging and handling runtime errors.
- Designing UML diagrams to visualize system workflows.

Although I faced challenges, such as reconnecting the database and handling errors, I successfully resolved them with research and guidance. This project has helped me improve my programming skills and gave me hands-on experience with software development.

## Conclusion
The Taxi Booking System is a user-friendly platform that simplifies taxi bookings. It helps customers reach their destinations on time while providing drivers with steady work. All features work well, and the system can expand with new technologies in the future.
This project has been a valuable learning experience, and Iâ€™m proud to share it on GitHub. I hope it inspires others to explore programming and system design!
